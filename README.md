# Period Overlap Checker
Period Overlap Checker is a C++ console application that reads two time periods and determines if they overlap. It uses the function IsOverlapPeriods(), which compares the start and end dates of both periods to check for any intersection. This tool is useful for handling scheduling conflicts, date range validations, and time-based logic.
